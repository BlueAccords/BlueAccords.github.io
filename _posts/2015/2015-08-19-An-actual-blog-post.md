I feel like I haven't accomplished nearly enough with the extremely generous amount of time I have lately.
Nearly twenty-four hours is available to me I can't even manage to do more than 1 chapter of eloquent javascript a day, if even that.

There needs to be a change so I'm going to start blogging about my daily goals in addition to just using this blog as a personal note taking repository.

For now I'm going to list my goals for tomorow. Hopefully listing them publically will instill some sense of accountability in me. If not at least I tried SOMETHING.

So my goals are as follows:

* Complete chapters 3-8 of Eloquent Javascript.
	* Finish taking notes and publishing posts for them on this blog.


Pretty simple and straightforward goals but the real challenge is in maintaining focus throughout the day to accomplish this.

If by 12 pm I still haven't accomplished anything I'll consider streaming on livecoding.tv again.
