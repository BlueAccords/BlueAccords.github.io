Well this blog is back up. Though I took it down a few weeks ago it's now officially back up.
My goal is to fix up the minor issues it has now and then actually write a little bit about
the projects I'm working on and the problems I encounter.  

my goal is to make at least one blog post a week. Anymore than that and it'll probably
be unrealistic. The best method to start for now is to aim low, and build up a habit.  

To end my first post after however long it's been, the projects i'm currently working on now
are  

*Draw With Me* A small project meant to allow people to upload photos to a group
together to allow easier sharing of art when drawing together(whether that be via traditional or digital.)

*Skyrim Mod Picker* A project meant to be like pc part picker but for skyrim mods. I'm currently only working
on minor stuff like tests/validations but I feel like it's for a good cause(that is making it easier to mod skyrim).
